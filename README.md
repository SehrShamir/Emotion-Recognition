# Emotion-Recognition
🎙️ Emotion Recognition from Speech using Machine Learning
🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an Emotion Recognition System that uses speech input to accurately classify various human emotions. By analyzing audio recordings, the model identifies and categorizes emotional states based on vocal characteristics.

🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect and classify the following emotions from human speech:

😠 Anger

😒 Disgust

😨 Fear

😃 Excitement

😐 Neutral

😲 Pleasant Surprise

😢 Sadness

🧪 Methodology

Data Collection

Speech audio samples labeled with emotion categories.

Preprocessing

Noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction (e.g., MFCC, pitch, energy).

Feature Engineering

Use of acoustic features to capture emotional cues.

Model Training

Applied machine learning algorithms for classification:

SVM

Random Forest

Neural Networks

Evaluation

Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics were used to assess model performance.

📌 Applications

Emotion recognition from speech has numerous real-world applications:

🤖 Human-Computer Interaction

☎️ Customer Service Automation

🧠 Psychiatric & Behavioral Research

🎮 Interactive Entertainment Systems
